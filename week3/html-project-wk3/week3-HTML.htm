            <p class="bahama-p">The Bahamas archipelago is an ecological oasis sprinkled over 100,000 square miles of ocean, starting just 50 miles off the coast of Florida. It comprises 700 breathtaking islands, over 2,000 rocks and cays, and boasts the clearest water on the planet with a visibility of over 200 feet. You can see your toes as easily as you can the world's third largest fringing barrier reef. <br> We invite you to explore all of our islands. One step and you'll realize our beauty extends far beyond our extraordinary natural wonders. It's the smiles on the faces of the Bahamian people. The unique sounds of our rich culture. The warm hospitality of our heritage and our colorful history. </p>

            <p class="hawaii-p">Located in the Pacific Ocean west of California, Hawaii is the only state to be completely surrounded by water. It consists of six main islands the Big Island, Maui, Kauai, Oahu, Molokai, and Lanai. Cascading waterfalls, black-sand beaches, and rugged canyons make Hawaii travel great for relaxation or adventure. And getting around is easy there's one major airport and several smaller ones. This Hawaii travel guide is filled with ideas to kick-start your vacation planning.

            <p class="fiji-p">With its turquoise waters, glittering sands and luxe resorts, Fiji is similar to many other tropical getaways. Likewise, the set of 333 islands caters to lovebirds of all kinds. Plus, adventure-seekers, like surfers and divers, appreciate the archipelago's quality waves and coral reefs. But Fiji differs from other island destinations in its otherworldliness. Since it's more than 1,300 miles from New Zealand's North Island in the South Pacific Ocean, Fiji affords you the delectable feeling of seclusion. You'll be as far from reality as possible when you're sipping Fiji Bitter beer and watching the sun dip below the horizon. Fijian customs will make you feel a million miles away too: Ever tasted the dizzying kava drink? Or watched men defy fire and walk across scalding stones without burning their feet? If not, it's about time you did.
