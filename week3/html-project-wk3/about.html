            This a a paragraph about tropical vacations. I'm trying to fill up as much space as possible so it looks nice on the page. If you live in the industrialized global North spending your days at an office desk, perhaps, or running around suburbs or cities, your trusty iPhone never more than a few inches away you could be forgiven for thinking tropical forests have little do with your daily life (other than providing fodder for vacation daydreams, of course). After all, tropical forests are home to howler monkeys, armadillos, and sloths. What could they possibly have to do with you?
